Observations & Suggestions – Voice Agent 

 

 

Test Call 1 (Child Policy Observation & Tonality) 

 

When accommodation at The Tamara Coorg was declined due to the child policy, the agent’s response came across as policy-driven and transactional, with minimal acknowledgment of the guest’s situation. 

 

There was no verbal expression of empathy such as “I understand this may be disappointing” or “I’m sorry this doesn’t work for your travel plans”, which would have helped soften the refusal and align the interaction with Tamara’s guest-centric ethos. 

 

Although alternative options at Kodaikanal were offered, the transition felt abrupt and functional, rather than being positioned as a thoughtful attempt to find a suitable solution for the guest. 

 

The agent did not attempt to retain the relationship by suggesting future possibilities (alternate dates, reconnecting at another time, or assisting with a different occasion). 

 

The call lacked a formal and courteous closing. When the guest indicated that the option did not work and suggested reconnecting later, the call ended abruptly without: 

A thank-you for calling, 

A closing courtesy statement, or 

Any reassurance of future assistance. 

 

From a communication perspective, the accent was noticeably westernized. While generally understandable, there were moments where clarity was reduced, requiring additional effort from the guest to follow the conversation. 

 

Improved modulation, pacing, and a slightly more neutral accent would enhance comprehension and comfort, especially for Indian callers. 

 

 

 

Test Call 2 (Festive Week & Call Flow Observations) 

 

Test call was made to the voice agent to enquire about a reservation at The Tamara Coorg. 

 

I had shared the travel dates as 14th February to 16th February for two adults, and the agent offered multiple room category options that were aligned with the categories listed on the official website. 

 

 

While the room categories were correctly shared, the rates quoted were significantly lower than the rates displayed on the website for the same dates. 

 

The agent initially quoted an AP (All-Inclusive) rate of ₹16,000 per night. Upon the guest declining the AP plan and requesting a CP (Breakfast-only) plan, the agent quoted a revised rate of ₹11,000 per night. 

 

 

These rates appeared inconsistent with the actual website rates, which are substantially higher (above ₹20,000 for the same period), leading to confusion and concern around rate accuracy. 

 

During the conversation, the agent asked about the purpose of travel (relaxation or celebration), to which the I responded that the visit was for relaxation. 

 

 

Based on this input, the agent appropriately highlighted the spa facilities and available treatments, which was relevant to the guest’s stated preference. 

 

Towards the end of the call, when the booking was nearly complete, I had enquired about the check-in time, which the agent stated as approximately 2:00 pm or 3:00 pm. 

 

 

While I was attempting to reconfirm the check-in time, the call got disconnected abruptly once again. 

 

On calling back, despite providing the same name and phone number, the agent/system was unable to retrieve the earlier interaction, and the call was once again handled as a new enquiry. 

 

 

Test Call 3 (Call Flow Observations with Elderly Guests) 

The agent did not clearly introduce themselves at the beginning of the call, and the guest was unable to catch or recall the agent’s name. While this may appear minor, it is critical for professionalism, accountability, and trust. 

 

The agent also struggled to capture the guest’s name correctly, and the overall phraseology used during the interaction felt awkward and inconsistent. 

 

A process related to eligibility (initially referred to as The Tamara Coorg by the guest) was handled smoothly; however, despite the guest clearly stating that the travel party consisted of three adults (the guest and parents), the agent still asked whether the guest was travelling with a child, which had already been clarified as no. 

 

In several instances, the agent took noticeable time to process questions and respond, leading to pauses that disrupted the natural flow of the conversation. 

 

Although the agent asked about the purpose of the vacation, and the guest clearly stated that the trip was intended to be relaxing with a few experiences, keeping in mind elderly parents, relevant experiences were described only when explicitly asked, rather than being proactively recommended. 

 

During email address confirmation, the agent was unable to capture the email ID correctly, even after the guest spelled it out multiple times (approximately five to six confirmations). 

 

As a result of the incorrect email capture, the agent was unable to send booking-related confirmations, impacting closure and follow-up. 

 

At one point during the call, the phone was handed over to Srikantan; however, the agent continued to address him as Manmita, indicating that the system did not recognize the change in speaker, voice, or gender. The agent should ideally recalibrate and switch to neutral or appropriate address (e.g., “Sir”) or reconfirm the speaker. 

 

When the guest asked how future queries would be linked without repeating information, the agent stated that name and phone number would allow retrieval of previous details. 

 

However, during an actual call-back attempt, even after providing the same phone number, the system failed to recall the earlier interaction, and the entire process had to be repeated from the beginning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Test Call 4 (Rate Negotiation & Pricing Observations) 

 

During this test call, the guest attempted to negotiate the rate offered by the agent. 

 

The agent initially proposed a change in the meal plan (moving to an EP plan) as a way to reduce the overall price, which is a reasonable commercial approach. 

 

After shifting to the EP plan, when the guest requested a slightly improved rate, the agent refused to revise the pricing and continued to repeat the same rate multiple times. 

 

The agent’s tone during this interaction came across as rigid and slightly unsettled, particularly when the guest did not accept the quoted rate, which negatively affected the conversational experience. 

 

Instead of offering value-based explanations or alternatives, the agent relied on rate repetition, indicating limited negotiation handling capability. 

 

The agent subsequently offered an accessible room as an alternative without providing any explanation of what an accessible room entails, which may lead to mis-selling or guest dissatisfaction. 

 

There were significant rate inconsistencies during the call. At one point, the agent quoted a rate of ₹9,000 for two nights, which appears unrealistic for the property and market, raising concerns around pricing accuracy. 

 

Additionally, when the guest clearly stated that a budget of ₹31,000 was already beyond comfort, the agent countered by offering a room priced at ₹40,000, indicating a lack of budget sensitivity and contextual understanding. 

 

Overall, the pricing conversation lacked logical progression, budget alignment, and clear justification, which may erode guest confidence and trust in the booking process. 

 

 

 

Test Call 5 (General Query and Rate Shopping) 

 

Test call on TTC -  have just completed a test call to TTC, and below are my observations from the interaction: 
 
1.The call started with a generic greeting, “How may I assist you today?”, after which I was asked to select the resort. 
 
2.Upon sharing the dates (23rd–26th December), availability was offered for Luxury Cottage, Suite Cottage, and Superior Cottage. 
 
3.When I mentioned that we are 3 adults travelling, the first option suggested was a Suite Cottage (which is appropriate). However, the second option suggested was a Superior Luxury Cottage, which is not permitted for 3 adults. 
 
4.On further questioning, the agent confirmed that the Superior Cottage can comfortably accommodate 3 adults, which is incorrect. 
 
5.When asked about extra bed availability in the Superior Cottage, the agent stated that an extra bed can be arranged. This is incorrect, as we do not provide extra beds in Superior or Luxury Cottages. 
 
6.Pricing was quoted for all categories; however, the prices seemed inconsistent. The agent initially quoted the price as per night, but upon reconfirmation, stated that the quoted amount was for 3 nights, which is again incorrect. 
 
7.Package inclusions and activities were explained; however, there was confusion regarding complimentary vs chargeable activities. Bird watching was initially stated as complimentary, whereas it is actually a chargeable activity. 
 
8.Call reconfirmation was completed. 
 
9.During email and contact number reconfirmation, the agent was unable to correctly capture the email ID and struggled to recognize the contact number despite it being repeated multiple times 

 

Test Call 6 (Follow up on Room Categories Observation) 

1. The agent did not recognise the previous call, despite the guest’s full name and contact number being already updated 


2.The agent treated the interaction as a fresh call and began by asking basic details such as the preferred resort and travel dates 

3.I informed the agent that I had already enquired earlier and was calling to confirm the booking. The agent then asked for the confirmation number 

4.When I clarified that I did not have a confirmation number as the booking was not yet completed, the agent again asked for the travel dates and number of guests 

5.The agent is currently not recognising follow-up calls based on the guest’s name or contact number, resulting in repetition of basic information
